### Middlewares

So, to implement middleware first I will need to specify that a route is using a given middleware

#### Idea

I will call a function at the top of the route file to say "Use this middleware"

```lua
-- /routes/profile.lua

useMiddleware("checkLoggedIn")

function GET()
    ...
end

-- /middlewares/checkLoggedIn.lua

function handle()
    local user = someCodeToGetUser()
    if(user.loggedIn) then
        request.user = user
    end
    return next()
end
```
>**NOTE**: maybe I'll change the name of the middleware function 


#### Middleware return value

The middleware function also need to return something to redirect or block a request
with a set of functions

```lua

    next() -- Continue the request execution flow as it is
    abort(status_code) -- Abort the request execution flow and returns the status code (403 by default)
    redirect(path) -- Redirect the request to path
```



#### Application

Middlewares will be registered as the useMiddleware function is executed
so between the ```lua_dofile(L,routes)``` and  the execution of the routes.
So we need a way of keeping a middleware list in memory before executing the route

##### Idea 1

We define a global variable that will be used to store the middleware list <br>
Then before we execute the routes we access that list of middlewares,execute each one of them, and 
then we execute route.

**POSSIBLE ISSUE** : The middleware `handle` functions will override each other since we need the same context.
As they will be executed one after the other,it should not pose a problem since the previous definition of `handle`
won't be necessary anymore.

### Configs hot reloading

While implementing middlewares, I have decided to also add hot reload of the 
`noon.config.lua` file ,since every script are loaded on execution ,it means that they
can be modified while executing but for the `noon.config.lua` file it's more complicated.
Since routes and app configs are in that file,we need to update the router and apps configs
as soon as the script is modified because that's the only file that is called only one, on startup.

### Problem #1 : Multi threading

So, the initial watcher was supposed to be in a separate thread but whenever I try to join it,
it blocks the entire app

### Middleware function rename
The middleware function has been renamed to `RouteHandler`to keep it recognizable since 
it's a global function

### Middlewares Parameters

Some middlewares might need parameters to avoid having to rewrite similar code.<br>
For example a middleware that only allows user with a certain role

```lua
-- /middlewares/checkRole
function RouteHandler(params)
    -- Fetch the user
    local user = db.users:get(request.body.id)
    -- If the user has the correct role
    if(user.role == params.role) then
        return next()
    else
        if(params.redirect_url != nil) then
            return redirect(params.redirect_url)
        else
            return abort(403)
        end
    end
end 
```

### Data fetching

Since I'm finally done with middlewares I would like to work on two of the most useful
features : **Data fetching** and **static file serving**.


## [Saturday 8,April 2023]

### Progression on static file serving
Finally , I have implemented static file serving...kinda...let me explain<br>
Static file serving is more complicated than it looks like for non-text based files, for now I am able to serve
text files which means javascript,css,xml and json.

#### How it works

Just put your file in the static folder and _voil√†_ 

```lua
<app>
    /routes
        ...
    /middlewares
        ...
    /static
        style.css
        app.js
```

### Data fetching

As I was trying to implement data fetching I realised that one of the reasons why it wasn't working
is because the server doesn't support the `https` protocol.So naturally, the next step will be to implement it
I've decided that I will use openssl as it's opensource and I can find a lot of documentation and basic examples on ~~ChatGPT~~ the internet

This should be my next objective together with binary/image file serving.

### Connections, SocketConnections and SSLConnections

So I have decided to implement the connection class to encapsulate the sockets and SSL sockets to make it easier.<br>
Having an abstraction layer allows me to handle HTTP and HTTPS connections the same way without having a bigger code base,
for now they will be used only for data fetching but those classes are designed to be used also on the server itself
so that instead of having a HttpServer and HttpsServer class we can just have a Server class with either a SSL Connection or a basic Socket Connection one

### SSL fixed

Somehow it works now...
